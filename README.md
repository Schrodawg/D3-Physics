A series of physics-based levels created by {Craig Schroeder} based on the Phaser 3.6.0 engine

Deployed on GitHib at : 

Code requirements:
- **The game uses both continuous and discrete inputs from the player**: 
- **The playerâ€™s goal can only be achieved indirectly (by allowing the physics engine to move key objects into position/contact).**: 
- **3+ physics-based gameplay scenes (possibly implemented with a single Phaser Scene subclass).**:
- **Other scenes are used to separate and contextualize the gameplay scenes**: 

Asset sources:
- Backgrounds were made in MS Paint. Objects like the plane, player, and grave in Adobe Photoshop.

- `game.js` was sketched by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly) and rewritten by me.
