A series of physics-based levels created by {Craig Schroeder} based on the Phaser 3.6.0 engine

Deployed on GitHib at : https://schrodawg.github.io/D3-Physics/

Code requirements:
- **The game uses both continuous and discrete inputs from the player**: The skateboard allows the player to move an object continuously. The intro requires a more direct input. 
- **The playerâ€™s goal can only be achieved indirectly (by allowing the physics engine to move key objects into position/contact).**: Level 3 features a free-fall, allowing the player to win by simply falling down. 
- **3+ physics-based gameplay scenes (possibly implemented with a single Phaser Scene subclass).**: 3 levels total.
- **Other scenes are used to separate and contextualize the gameplay scenes**: 3 summaries between each level recording time.
